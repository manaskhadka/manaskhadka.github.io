		<h1>My Mission</h1>
		<p style="text-align: center">
			I believe technology exists to improve people’s lives. That’s why I dedicate myself to making software that brings communities together, helps
			people solve problems, or simply gets a chuckle or grin out of whoever is using it. Anything to make someone’s day a little brighter.

				<h3>The Joy of Creation</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left">
					Finishing a school project or essay, figuring out how to configure a piece of furniture, or just drawing a picture can feel so satisfying.
					There’s a certain joy in building things and the feeling of “I made this”. Through programming, I create, and through that creation, I
					fulfill my creative and problem-solving urges.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-right">
				<h3>The Joy of Giving</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left">
					Helping and teaching others holds its own joys. Helping a friend out when they’re in need and seeing their gratitude or teaching a colleague
					and seeing them succeed feels amazing. This is what builds community; this brings everyone happiness. Doing something for someone else and
					seeing them smile is always worth the effort.
				</p>

		<p style="text-align: center">
			I chase these two feelings. They uplift me and inspire me. My goal is to combine these two inspirations and create with the purpose of making
			people happy.
